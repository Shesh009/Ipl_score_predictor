# Ipl_score_predictor

This is a project based on the score prediction of IPL matches where we can give batting team name,bowling team name,overs completed,runs scored and wickets lost,runs scored in last 5 overs and wickets lost in last 5 overs.
Then we can predict how much runs can the batting team score in 20 overs.
